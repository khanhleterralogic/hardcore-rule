3) r-- : read apply for other users belong to file's group
4) r-- : read apply for other users of system

- chmod 777: apply for files/folders

###Protecting and Sharing Files

- All users in a group **can read** documents stored by their manager

####Directors's access permissions

- A user has **read** permission for dir can run see (ls).
- A user has **write** permission for dir can add, rename, delete files in directory
- A user has **execute** permission for dir can access dir then do somethings as read/write the files...)

Example in Unix:

- --- user can not access the directory
- r-x user be able to access with read-only permission
- rwx user be able to access read and write permission

####Files's access permissions

**Abbreation**:
1) u: user(owner), g: group, o: others, a: all
2) +: add permission, -: remove permission, =: equal, assign

- Files often do not have **execute** permission except script files, program files.
- chmod a-w <filename>: remove write permission apply for all
- chmod u+w <filename>: add write permission for owner
- chomod ug=rw *: add r+w to owner and group apply for * files

###Chaning the Group an Owner

- In smaller area you are super admin of what folder that you've created
